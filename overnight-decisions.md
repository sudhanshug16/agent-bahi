# Overnight Decisions

These entries record reversible working decisions for the first Gate0 slice. A status that says `OWNER REVIEW PENDING` is not owner approval.

## OD-001 — Gate0 authorization boundary

- **Date**: 2026-08-22
- **Decision**: Implement only the first local, reversible Gate0 proof slice: Bun project scaffolding, SQLite proofs, compile-only target attempts, and evidence. Do not implement the accounting engine, use external databases, touch production data, or treat this work as Phase 1 authorization.
- **Alternatives**: Wait for a later implementation authorization; begin Phase 1 alongside the proof; run against a shared/external database.
- **Evidence**: Explicit task authorization; `docs/discovery/implementation-plan.md` defines Gate0 as a hard blocker before Phase 1.
- **Reversibility**: Delete the proof project and evidence, or replace individual adapters after review; no production state is changed.
- **Status**: `OWNER-AUTHORIZED FOR GATE0 ONLY; PHASE 1 NOT AUTHORIZED`.

## OD-002 — Relational SQL over NoSQL

- **Date**: 2026-08-22
- **Decision**: Keep SQL and relational constraints as the persistence direction for accounting facts. Use hand-reviewed SQL migrations and explicit transaction boundaries.
- **Alternatives**: Document/NoSQL primary store; event-only storage; ORM-generated schema as the source of truth.
- **Evidence**: SQLite proof demonstrates composite tenant/BookSet foreign keys, balance checks, uniqueness, append-only guards, WAL, and writer serialization. The architecture contract requires relational current state and an immutable accounting journal.
- **Reversibility**: A future adapter can implement the application ports, but changing the canonical persistence model requires a new reviewed architecture decision and migration plan.
- **Status**: `AGENT-RECOMMENDED / OWNER REVIEW PENDING`.

## OD-003 — Tenant Option A candidate

- **Date**: 2026-08-22
- **Decision**: Recommend two company tenants plus one individual/PAN tenant containing one personal BookSet and one or more proprietorship BookSets. Keep BookSets independently scoped and balanced; do not create cross-tenant paired writes.
- **Alternatives**: Separate personal/proprietorship tenants with a privileged PAN registry; a non-posting personal workspace.
- **Evidence**: `docs/discovery/post-discovery-readiness.md` Option A candidate and the Gate0 contract's composite tenant/BookSet FK proof. This slice does not prove the complete personal-tax schema or authorization model.
- **Reversibility**: Preserve tenant and BookSet IDs behind ports; an architect may choose the registry alternative before Phase 1 physical schema work.
- **Status**: `AGENT-RECOMMENDED / OWNER REVIEW PENDING`.

## OD-004 — Drizzle candidate with Bun-native fallback

- **Date**: 2026-08-22
- **Decision**: Proof-gate `drizzle-orm@0.44.7` only as a typed infrastructure candidate behind application ports. Keep native `bun:sqlite` as the working fallback and use SQL-first migrations. Do not use Drizzle push or runtime auto-generation.
- **Alternatives**: Native Bun SQL only; adopt Drizzle as the domain-facing persistence API; choose Kysely or another ORM before proof.
- **Evidence**: `src/infrastructure/sqlite/drizzle-candidate.ts` is the only Drizzle import surface; `src/application` and `src/domain` have no Drizzle imports. `bun.lock`, typecheck, and native SQLite tests pass; PostgreSQL/MySQL proofs remain blocked.
- **Reversibility**: Replace the candidate adapter without changing domain/application ports. Loss triggers are a Bun compatibility regression, inability to preserve reviewed SQL/checksum behavior, tenant/BookSet constraint gaps, transaction/locking mismatch, or unacceptable bundle/runtime behavior.
- **Status**: `AGENT-RECOMMENDED / OWNER REVIEW PENDING`.

## OD-005 — Schema version and CLI compatibility

- **Date**: 2026-08-22
- **Decision**: Keep a schema logical version/ID and migration checksum distinct from CLI semantic version. Maintain an explicit compatibility matrix for CLI schema versions and refuse checksum mismatches. Do not run schema migrations mid-operation; migrations are an explicit pre-operation step.
- **Alternatives**: Use CLI semver as schema version; auto-migrate during a command; allow mixed schema versions without a compatibility decision.
- **Evidence**: `gate0-001-core-sqlite` stores its logical ID and checksum in `schema_migrations`; a same-ID tamper is refused in the proof. The domain-owned CLI registry reports `0.0.0-gate0` independently.
- **Reversibility**: Add compatibility rows and reviewed migrations; never rewrite applied migration history. A future breaking schema requires a new compatibility entry and explicit cutover/rollback plan.
- **Status**: `AGENT-RECOMMENDED / OWNER REVIEW PENDING`.

### Compatibility matrix (initial)

| CLI semver | Schema logical IDs | Read/write policy |
|---|---|---|
| `0.0.0-gate0` | `gate0-001-core-sqlite` | Proof-only; no production writes; no mid-operation migration |
| future `0.x` | Explicitly recorded migration set | Must be reviewed before use; mismatch fails closed |
| future `1.x` | Explicit compatibility entry required | No implicit downgrade or mixed-version write |

## OD-006 — Imports last, shadow before cutover

- **Date**: 2026-08-22
- **Decision**: Keep Zoho/external imports as the final migration lane. Before any cutover, import into a shadow representation, validate/reconcile against canonical books, preserve source evidence and hashes, and require an explicit cutover decision.
- **Alternatives**: Let imports shape the canonical model now; perform a direct destructive cutover; omit shadow validation.
- **Evidence**: Discovery roadmap and implementation plan defer Zoho import to Phase 9; the architecture contract makes imported data non-authoritative until validated.
- **Reversibility**: Source artifacts and shadow data remain available; failed reconciliation leaves canonical books unchanged.
- **Status**: `AGENT-RECOMMENDED / OWNER REVIEW PENDING`.
